            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are some great articles such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdf">this</a>, and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-the-math-behind-neural-networks-ac15e178bbd">this</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;explained how some of the important Math concepts related to Gradient Descent. Here in this section, we will provide a summary to their conclusion for reference when you are looking at derivation for weight matrix for different papers LSTM, Transformer, and Vanilla.</p>
